      <h2>Second Year's Modules</h2>

   <body class="modules">

    <h3>Software Hut</h3>
    <p>The Software Hut (a microcosm of a real Software House) gives students an opportunity to experience the processes of engineering a real software system for a real client in a competitive environment. The taught element covers the tools and technologies needed to manage software development projects successfully and to deliver software products that meet both client expectations and quality standards. Topics that are put into practice include: the requirements engineering process; software modelling and testing; using specific software development framework(s); group project management etc. Tutorials take the form of project meetings, and so are concerned with team management, conduct of meetings and action minutes.</p>

    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
   	<p>This module introduces the principles of functional programming, using the Haskell programming language. It introduces types and classes, function definitions, list comprehension, recursive and higher order functions, eager and lazy evaluation, and basic data types.</p>
   	<hr>
   	<h3>Data-Driven Computing</h3>
   	<p>This module is intended to serve as an introduction to machine learning and pattern processing, but with a clear emphasis on applications. The module is themed around the notion of data as a resource; how it is acquired, prepared for analysis and finally how we can learn from it. The module will employ a practical Python-based approach to try and help students develop an intuitive grasp of the sophisticated mathematical ideas that underpin this challenging but fascinating subject.</p>
   	<hr>
   	<h3>Robotics</h3>
   	<p>This module is concerned with the design and implementation of the technology underpinning contemporary robotics. The course has a multidisciplinary content spanning psychology, computer science and robotics.</p>
   	<hr>
   	<h3>Systems Design and Security</h3>
   	<p>This module is concerned with the software systems design process, including security issues. It covers the appropriate choice of software lifecycle model, the interactions between developer and customer, the conceptual management of information from requirements through to detailed design, the development of an efficient and secure database, the design of robust user interfaces, the validation and protection of stored data, and associated techniques to counter common security threats. The two assessments will be: an integrating group project, connecting user interfaces, business processing and data storage; and an individual examination. </p>
   	<hr>
   	<h3>Logic in Computer Science</h3>
   	<p>This module introduces the foundations of logic in computer science. The first part introduces the syntax and semantics of propositional and predicate logics, natural deduction, and notions such as soundness, completeness and (un)decidability. The second part covers applications in computer science and beyond, such as automated reasoning and decision procedures, modal and temporal logics for the verification of computing systems, and type systems for programming languages.</p>
   	<hr>
   	<h3>Automata, Computation and Complexity</h3>
   	<p>This module introduces the theoretical foundations for computing systems: finite state machines, pushdown automata, and Turing machines, along with the formal languages that can be recognised by these machine models. It also deals with the question "What is computable?" and "What is efficiently computable?" by showing when problems are computationally hard, and how to find algorithmic solutions to computationally hard problems.</p>
